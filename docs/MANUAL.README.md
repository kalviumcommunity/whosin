# Manual Mode

It is a predefined mode that comes with the app. It is a simple mode where there are two groups of users namely `facilitators` and `participants`. The group of users allowed to create a session and mark the status of the users are `facilitators`. The `participants` can only view their status.

## Working

1. A `facilitator` creates a session. The session is given a unique code.
2. Each `facilitator` and `participant` has a unique code.
3. By default each `participant` status is `pending`.
4. A `facilitator` can mark a `participant` as `present` or `absent`.
5. In order to mark a `participant` a `facilitator` code is required.
